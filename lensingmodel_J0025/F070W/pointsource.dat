#first row: ID n_img zs err_zs
# ID can be arbitrary number.
#  n_img is the number of lensed images
#  zs is the redshift of the background source
#  err_zs is the redshift uncertainty of the background source
#

# following rows: information of the lensed images: x[1] y[1] f[1] err_xy[1] err_f[1] dt[1] err_dt[1] parity[1]
# x[1], y[1] are the coordinates of the lensed images, in arcsec
# f[1] is the flux (not the magnitude)
# err_xy[1] is the error of x and y
# err_f[1] is the error of the flux
# remaining fields are not usef for now, just set them to 0
# for additional lensed images, add more rows following the same format.
